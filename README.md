Bridge dealer
=============

This is a work in progress of a program I started before Makers, to deal, sort, and present in typical format random hands for the card game Contract Bridge. 

I'd like to come back to it at some stage, or start a TDD version from scratch. I want to turn it into something that can be tailored to produce more specific hands than the online hand dealers that I know of.

To run it with ruby installed (any recent version should do), just go to the root directory and type 'ruby bridgedealer.rb'
